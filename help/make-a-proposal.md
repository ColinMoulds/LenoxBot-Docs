* Just fill out all answers and wait for feedback from the Proposalwriters.

After you have answered all the questions, your suggestion will be sent in the \#processing-proposals channel. In this channel the "Proposalwriter" processed your suggestion. They can accept your suggestion, reject it, add notes or attach a screenshot.

After your suggestion has been accepted by three different Proposalwriters, you will receive 100 crtedits as a reward. In addition, your report will be moved to the archive.
