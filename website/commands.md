# Commands

Hey there, here we'd like to show you the ways, how to see our commands.

### There are 2 different ways, to see all of our commands or all the commands of a module.

First you can see it on our [**website**](https://lenoxbot.com/commands). There is an overview of each module and you can also search a command.

The second way is over the bot itself.

Just type `?commands` or `?cmds` and the Name of the module, of which you'd like to see the commands. An example:

* `?commands Searches` **/** `?cmds Searches`

## **Generates:**
