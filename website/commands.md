# Commands

Hey there, here we'd like to show you the ways, how to see our Commands. 

##### There are 2 different ways, to see all of our Commands or all the Commands of a Module.

First you can see it on our **[website](https://lenoxbot.com/commands)**.
There is an overview of each Module and you can also search a command.

The second way is over the Bot itself.

Just type `?commands` or `?cmds` and the Name of the Modulde, of which you'd like to see the commands. An example:

* `?commands Searches` **/** `?cmds Searches`

#### **Generates:**
