# Daily streak

The daily streak is a feature of the "_?daily"_ command_._ If you use the command the first one you will have a streak of one.

But if you would do this next day \(in 24 hours\) you will have a streak of _two_ and will get **204 credits** and not ~~202 credits~~. It's like a bonus for the active users.

For everyone who has got a userkey get the dopple of the credits. A userkey you will get by [donating for LenoxBot](https://lenoxbot.com/donate).
