# My credits are gone

## My credits are gone, what can I do?

Rarely it happens that credits just disappear, so we need precise information what you have previously entered as a command to investigate the problem.

That's why we ask you to create a ticket \(**?ticket**\) on the LenoxBot Discord Server with the following informations:

* Your Discord username 
* Your Discord user ID
* When did you have your credits? 
* Which command\(s\) did you use before your credits disappear?

{% hint style="info" %}
In any case, in which the credits have disappeared, we will refund them, so don't worry about that!
{% endhint %}
