An example of a Markdown file is:

```text
title: Reminder of daily (Only search engines will see this description!)
description: If you want to activate the daily reminder, here you can find how you do this (Only search engines will see this description!)

# Reminder of daily

You want a reminder for your daily rewards? That's no problem!
Use the command **?dailyremind** and your daily reminder is activated. 

If you want to delete the daily reminder, you must only use the command again.
You don't understand the command? Use **?help dailyremind**:

## What do I need to pay attention for?

* The title \(that is on top of each Markdown file\) has to be the same as the name of the file.
* The description \(that is on top of each Markdown file\) should not contain more than 30 words and explain what's the content about.
* All documentation entries should be clear and understandable
* Any newly created documentation entries must have the markdown format \(.md at the end of the filename\).
* Please set in every entry a headline with \# \[name of headline\]
